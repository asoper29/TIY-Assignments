<h1>I am <span>Batman</span></h1>

    <p>It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.

        I take what I need from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of the people with less.
        
        This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.
        
        You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.
        
        I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.
        
        Once you've done what you had to, they never let you do what you want to.
        
        You don't owe these people anymore. You've given them everything.
        
        <span>Now choice is yours: <span>exile</span> or death?</span>
        
        <span id='pain'>It will be extremely painful... for you</span>
        
        But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding.
        
        Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.
        
        To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?
        
        Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.
        
        You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.
        
        It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.
        
        Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.
        
        I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
        
        That's a lovely lovely voice!
